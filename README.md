# Concurrent Producers and Consumers with Thread Intensity 

This Java project illustrates the capabilities of working with concurrent situations, primarily focusing on multithreading. It presents a basic implementation of a Blocking Queue, a data structure that allows multiple threads to add and remove items simultaneously.

## Overview

- **BlockingQueue.java**: Manages the queue and tracks read intensity, demonstrating concurrent access.

- **Main.java**: Orchestrates producer and consumer threads, highlighting their synchronized operation.
